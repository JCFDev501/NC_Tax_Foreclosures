# NC_Tax_Foreclosures
This is a tax foreclosure website that I developed for a client, the client wanted to have a web site that collect and displayed acurate data on tax foreclosure properties in North Carolina

** I AM NOT ALLOWED TO SHARE THE WHOLE PROJECT, BUT I CAN SHARE SOME FILES...

This project was made with the following languages and frameworks:
-- React --> We decided to use React for the frontend.
-- Python flask --> we use flask for the backend this way we can use things like flask user mixin
-- TailwindCSS --> we are using tailwind for the design of the website
-- Google cloud platform --> we decided to deploy and manage the app using GCP 
-- Scrapy --> We use scrapy to web crawl the internet for our relavent data
-- Postgresql --> this is that data base we decided to go with to store all relevant data like users and taxforeclosure props
-- ARKGIS --> we used this to display our properties on the map

As the full stack dev it was my responsibilty to design and implement all the features mentioned above. Here are some screen shots..
